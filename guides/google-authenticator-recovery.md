# Google Authenticator Recovery Guide

This guide provides steps to recover access to your accounts when you lose your device with Google Authenticator installed.

## Immediate Actions

1. **Access Your Accounts Using Backup Codes**
   - For each service secured with Google Authenticator, use the backup codes you saved during setup
   - These are typically 8-10 digit codes provided when you first enabled 2FA
   - Most services provide 8-10 backup codes for emergency use

2. **Reset 2FA on Critical Accounts**
   - For accounts without backup codes, use alternative recovery methods:
     - Recovery email
     - Recovery phone number
     - Identity verification processes offered by the service

3. **Download Google Authenticator on a New Device**
   - Install from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) or [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)

## Restoring Your Accounts

1. **Manual Setup Method**
   - For each account, you'll need to:
     - Log into the account using backup codes or alternative methods
     - Disable the existing 2FA setup
     - Re-enable 2FA with your new device
     - Scan the new QR code with your new Google Authenticator installation

2. **Using Google Account Transfer (Newer Versions)**
   - If you previously set up your Google account in Authenticator with a newer version:
     - On your new device, tap "Get Started" in Google Authenticator
     - Select "Import existing accounts"
     - Follow the prompts to transfer accounts from your Google account
     - You may need to verify your identity

3. **Using Export Feature (If Previously Configured)**
   - If you previously used the export feature to back up to another device:
     - On the backup device, open Google Authenticator
     - Tap the three dots menu → "Transfer accounts" → "Export accounts"
     - Select the accounts to export
     - On your new device, use "Import accounts" to scan the QR code

## Preventive Measures for the Future

1. **Keep Backup Codes Secure**
   - Store backup codes for all services in a secure location separate from your phone
   - Consider keeping a hard copy in a safe or secure location
   - Update your backup code storage whenever you add new accounts

2. **Set Up Multiple Methods**
   - Where possible, configure multiple 2FA methods (SMS, email, authenticator app)
   - This provides redundancy if one method becomes unavailable

3. **Use Google Authenticator's Export Feature**
   - Periodically export your accounts to a secondary secure device
   - Three dots menu → "Transfer accounts" → "Export accounts"

4. **Consider Alternative Authenticator Apps**
   - Apps that offer cloud backups (with proper encryption) can simplify recovery
   - Examples include Authy or Microsoft Authenticator

5. **Document Your Setup**
   - Create a secure record of which accounts use Google Authenticator
   - This helps ensure you don't miss any accounts during recovery

## Note About Account Recovery

Google Authenticator itself does not have built-in cloud backup for most users. If you lose access to the app without backup codes or alternative recovery methods, you may need to go through each service's account recovery process, which varies by provider and can sometimes be lengthy.
