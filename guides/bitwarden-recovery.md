# BitWarden Recovery Guide After Device Loss

This guide provides steps to secure and recover your BitWarden password manager after losing your mobile device.

## Immediate Steps

1. **Access BitWarden from Another Device**
   - Use a trusted computer or secondary device to log into your BitWarden account at [vault.bitwarden.com](https://vault.bitwarden.com)
   - You'll need your master password to access your vault

2. **Verify Your Account Security**
   - Check for any unauthorized access or login attempts in your account activity logs
   - Look for any devices you don't recognize in your account settings

3. **Revoke Sessions from Lost Device**
   - Go to "Settings" → "My Account" → "Active Sessions"
   - Identify and deauthorize any sessions from your lost device
   - This will log out BitWarden on your lost device

4. **Review Two-Factor Authentication**
   - If you used your lost device for 2FA with BitWarden:
     - Use your backup recovery codes to access your account 
     - If using an authenticator app on the lost device, set up a new 2FA method immediately

5. **Change Master Password**
   - As a precaution, consider changing your BitWarden master password
   - Go to "Settings" → "My Account" → "Change Master Password"
   - Create a strong, unique password that you haven't used before

## Preventive Measures for the Future

1. **Emergency Access**
   - Consider setting up emergency access for a trusted person (Premium feature)
   - This allows designated contacts to request access to your vault in emergencies

2. **Recovery Codes**
   - Ensure your BitWarden recovery codes are stored securely outside of your vault
   - Store printed copies in a secure physical location
   - Consider a secondary digital backup (not on your primary device)

3. **Multiple Device Access**
   - Install BitWarden on multiple devices to ensure redundant access
   - Consider a desktop application in addition to mobile

4. **Export Vault Data**
   - Regularly export an encrypted backup of your vault
   - Store this export securely (encrypted external drive or secure cloud storage)
   - Update this export when you make significant changes to your vault

## Restoring BitWarden on a New Device

1. **Install the App**
   - Download BitWarden from the official app store
   - Verify you're installing the authentic application

2. **Log In**
   - Use your email and master password
   - Complete any 2FA requirements using your alternative methods or recovery codes

3. **Verify Vault Integrity**
   - Check that all your passwords and secure notes are available
   - Verify that any folders and organizations are intact

4. **Re-enable Biometrics**
   - Set up fingerprint or face recognition authentication for convenience and security

5. **Test Critical Passwords**
   - Verify that autofill and copy/paste functions work properly for important accounts

## Security Assessment

After recovering access to your BitWarden account, conduct a security review:

1. **Password Audit**
   - Use BitWarden's password health reports to identify compromised or weak passwords
   - Prioritize updating credentials for financial and critical accounts

2. **Check Account Activity**
   - Review the login history for any suspicious access
   - Verify that only your authorized devices can access your vault

3. **Update Recovery Methods**
   - Ensure all recovery methods are current and accessible from multiple devices

By following these steps, you can maintain access to your passwords while ensuring your BitWarden vault remains secure even after losing your mobile device.
