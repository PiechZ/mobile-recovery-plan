# Account Recovery Checklist

## Steps for Recovering Accounts Linked to Your Lost Device

1. **Identify Accounts**: 
   - Make a list of all accounts that were linked to your mobile device (e.g., email, social media, banking, etc.).

2. **Access Recovery Options**:
   - Visit the login page of each account and look for the "Forgot Password?" or "Account Recovery" option.

3. **Use Alternative Recovery Methods**:
   - If you have set up recovery options (like a backup email or phone number), use them to receive recovery codes or links.

4. **Reset Passwords**:
   - Follow the instructions provided to reset your passwords. Ensure that you create strong, unique passwords for each account.

5. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
   - Once you regain access, enable 2FA on your accounts to enhance security. Use an alternative method for 2FA if you cannot access your Google Authenticator.

6. **Review Account Activity**:
   - Check for any unauthorized activity on your accounts. Report any suspicious actions to the respective service providers.

7. **Update Security Questions**:
   - If applicable, update your security questions and answers to ensure they are not easily guessable.

8. **Inform Contacts**:
   - Notify important contacts that your phone was lost and that they should be cautious of any unusual messages or requests from you.

9. **Monitor Accounts**:
   - Keep an eye on your accounts for any unusual activity for a few weeks after recovery.

10. **Document Recovery Steps**:
    - Keep a record of the steps you took for future reference and to improve your recovery plan.

11. **Linked Accounts**:
    - Refer to the [Linked Accounts](linked-accounts.md) file for a list of accounts associated with your mobile device.
